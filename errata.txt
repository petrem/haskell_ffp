  runState f >> f 0  --->  runState (f >> f) 0

- 24.3 Parsing practice, exercise 2, p. 904
  * Are we supposed to write a parser (:: Parser String), or a function
    taking a string and parsing it? Following the example it has type
    'p123 :: String -> IO ()' or perhaps 'p123 :: String -> Result String' (see next bullet too)
  * Example outputs Success 123 ---> Success "123"

- 24 Failure and Backtracking, p. 941
  * Descriptions and code are misaligned, e.g. "Helper function for attoparsecâ€”same deal as before:" is followed by nobackParse instead of attoP which is before it.
